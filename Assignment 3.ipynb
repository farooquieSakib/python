    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Function is a group of code. The code inside a function runs only when you have called a function. When you want to reuse a set of code in an another program functions are more useful as you dont have to rewrite the same code/logic again. It reduces the need for duplicate code. It makes the program more readable and easier to maintain.\n"

    "\n",

There are 3 types of local scope when searched inside a function: Local(L), Global (G) and built-in(B). It stops at the first place where the name is found."
